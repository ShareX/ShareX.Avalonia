# XIP0042 ImageEditor SkiaSharp hardware acceleration for image effects

## Summary

**Goal:** Use SkiaSharp's GPU backend for image effects where possible, and speed up remaining CPU paths. **Scope:** ShareX.ImageEditor (ImageEditor) -> adjustment/filter effects and their application pipeline. **ImageEditor is shared and used by two hosts:**
- **XerahS** - Avalonia desktop app; embeds EditorView. GPU wiring deferred to Phase 3 - see Section 3.
- **ShareX** - WinForms app; opens the modern ImageEditor via `AvaloniaIntegration.ShowEditorDialog` (Avalonia window). Same ImageEditor codebase, different host process. Any change to ImageEditor (effects, pipeline, or optional GPU path) **must remain compatible with both hosts**. The host may provide an optional `GRContext` when applying effects; when not provided (`null`), the software path is always used (no breaking change for either host). Neither host currently provides one - intentional for Phases 1 and 2 (see Section 3 for why). **Recommended execution order:** | Phase | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Per-pixel CPU effects (BlackAndWhite, ReplaceColor, SelectiveColor) | [DONE] |
| **2** | CPU optimisations and code health | Mostly done; some profile-gated |
| **3** | GPU acceleration via canvas compositor + persistent `GRContext` | [DEFERRED] Deferred - pursue when canvas compositor is designed |

## Current State (as of Feb 2026)

> **Jaex landed two rounds of optimisations/fixes; all remaining ImageEditor-side items were then implemented in `feature/XIP0042-optimizations`. A third round added diagnostics infrastructure and addressed build-time discoveries. The GPU path in the ImageEditor library is complete, but host wiring is intentionally deferred: the Avalonia 11 frame-scoped API (`AvaloniaLocator / ISkiaGpuWithPlatformGraphicsContext`) is fragile and cannot be used outside a render callback, and a persistent offscreen `GRContext` (the only viable path) has a readback cost that negates the benefit for the color-matrix/filter operations targeted in early phases. GPU wiring will be pursued at Phase 3 (canvas compositor). See Section 3.**

### Round 1 (prior audit)
- [DONE] `ApplyPixelOperation` rewritten with `unsafe` pointer arithmetic for `Bgra8888` -> no `GetPixel`/`SetPixel`.

### Round 2 (this audit)
- [DONE] `GlowImageEffect` -> `AutoResize` param added; asymmetric canvas expansion (only expands on the side the glow/offset extends to).
- [DONE] `ShadowImageEffect` -> Removed `Darkness`, added `Color` property; same asymmetric expansion pattern as Glow.
- [DONE] `ReflectionImageEffect` -> Fixed flip matrix (proper `Translate + Scale` instead of pivot-based scale); canvas width now accounts for skew displacement.
- [DONE] `OutlineImageEffect` -> `OutlineOnly` mode added (DstOut erase of inner area).
- [DONE] `SliceImageEffect` -> Robust `minSliceHeight`/`maxSliceHeight`/`minSliceShift`/`maxSliceShift` bounds checking.

### Round 3 (post-implementation: diagnostics + build fixes)
- [NOTE] `SKSamplingOptions` (Section 2.4) **reverted** - specific overloads (`SKCubicResampler.Mitchell`, `SKBitmap.Resize(info, SKSamplingOptions)`) absent in SkiaSharp 2.88.9; code remains on `SKFilterQuality` pending a SkiaSharp upgrade.

- `ReadPixels` corrected to the **5-arg overload** in the GPU surface read-back path (Phase 3 build fix).
- [DONE] `SKCanvasControl` rewritten to use `ICustomDrawOperation` + `ISkiaSharpApiLeaseFeature` - correct Avalonia 11 pattern for obtaining `GRContext` during custom Skia rendering.
- [DONE] `IEditorDiagnosticsSink` / `EditorDiagnosticEvent` / `EditorDiagnosticLevel` added to `ShareX.ImageEditor.Services` - host-agnostic interface for observability.
- [DONE] `EditorServices.Diagnostics` property wired in ImageEditor; GPU path decision points (`SetGpuContext`, `ApplyColorFilter` GPU/CPU branch) emit structured diagnostic events.
- [DONE] `EditorDiagnosticsAdapter` added to XerahS (`XerahS.UI.Services`) - routes `IEditorDiagnosticsSink` events to `DebugHelper.WriteLine` / `WriteException`.
- [DONE] Wired in `App.axaml.cs`: `EditorServices.Diagnostics = new EditorDiagnosticsAdapter()`.
- [DONE] `src/desktop/app/run-debug-app.sh` added - convenience script to launch the desktop app in Debug configuration for GPU path verification.

## 0. Dual-host compatibility (XerahS + ShareX)

ImageEditor lives in a shared codebase consumed by **XerahS** and **ShareX**. Both use the same Avalonia-based EditorWindow/EditorView when the modern editor is enabled (ShareX: `UseModernImageEditor` -> `AvaloniaIntegration.ShowEditorDialog`). Compatibility rules:

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **No host-specific APIs in ImageEditor core/effects** | ImageEditor must not reference XerahS-only or ShareX-only assemblies. Effect pipeline and `ApplyColorFilter` helper stay in `ShareX.ImageEditor` with no dependency on host. |
| **GRContext is optional and provided by the host** | The effect library accepts an optional `GRContext` (or delegate). When `null` or not set, the existing software path runs. No requirement for either host to provide it. Neither host provides it currently - intentional (Section 3). |
| **Host GPU wiring deferred to Phase 3** | The Avalonia 11 render-lease API is frame-scoped and cannot be used at effect-application call sites. A persistent offscreen `GRContext` (Option B, Section 3.3) is the only correct approach but its readback cost negates the benefit for Phase 1/2 color-matrix/filter operations. Revisit when the canvas compositor (Phase 3) is designed - that is where GPU acceleration delivers a real, measurable win. |
| **Phase 1 (BlackAndWhite, ReplaceColor, SelectiveColor)** | Pure ImageEditor code; no host dependency. Behaves identically in both hosts. |
| **Validation** | When implementing, ensure ImageEditor builds and effect behavior is unchanged in both repo configurations (XerahS and ShareX). Optionally validate GPU path in XerahS and software fallback in both. |

---

## 1. Phase 1: Per-pixel effects

### 1a. BlackAndWhite -> color matrix [DONE] **Current code** (`BlackAndWhiteImageEffect.Apply`):

```csharp
return ApplyPixelOperation(source, (color) => { float lum = 0.2126f * color.Red + 0.7152f * color.Green + 0.0722f * color.Blue; return lum > 127 ? SKColors.White : SKColors.Black; });
```

**Problem:** Uses `ApplyPixelOperation` so it cannot use the GPU path even after Phase 3 is implemented. Also note it discards source alpha (replaces every pixel with fully-opaque White or Black - intentional behaviour, not a bug, but document it). **Proposed change:** Replace with a two-pass color-filter approach:
1. **Pass 1 -> luminance grayscale** (same matrix already used by `GrayscaleImageEffect` at strength=100):

```csharp
float[] grayscale = { 0.2126f, 0.7152f, 0.0722f, 0, 0, 0.2126f, 0.7152f, 0.0722f, 0, 0, 0.2126f, 0.7152f, 0.0722f, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 }; using var step1 = ApplyColorMatrix(source, grayscale); // thread grContext when Phase 3 GPU is implemented
```

2. **Pass 2 -> hard threshold** via `SKColorFilter.CreateTable` with a step function:

```csharp
byte[] table = new byte[256]; for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) table[i] = i < 128 ? (byte)0 : (byte)255; byte[] alphaTable = new byte[256]; for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) alphaTable[i] = 255; // force fully opaque (matches old behaviour) using var filter = SKColorFilter.CreateTable(alphaTable, table, table, table); return ApplyColorFilter(step1, filter); // thread grContext when Phase 3 GPU is implemented
```

- After Pass 1, all three RGB channels are equal (the luminance value). The table maps 0-127 -> 0, 128-255 -> 255. Alpha is forced to 255 (matches original behaviour of dropping source alpha).
- This route goes through `ApplyColorFilter` and is therefore GPU-eligible when Phase 3 is implemented. **Deliverables (Phase 1a):** - `BlackAndWhiteImageEffect.Apply` uses the two-pass color-filter approach.
- No `ApplyPixelOperation` call remains in `BlackAndWhiteImageEffect`.
- Behaviour is pixel-for-pixel identical to the existing implementation (validate with test images including transparent regions).

### 1b. ReplaceColor and SelectiveColor: fast pixel loop [DONE] (by Jaex, Round 1) `Adjustments/ImageEffect.cs::ApplyPixelOperation` uses `unsafe` pointer arithmetic (`SKColor*`) for `Bgra8888` format; falls back to `source.Pixels` managed array for other color types. No `GetPixel`/`SetPixel`. **No further work required.**

---

## 2. Phase 2: CPU optimisations and code health

### 2.1 `ColorizeImageEffect` - refactor to use helper [DONE] `ColorizeImageEffect.Apply` currently bypasses the base class helpers and manages its own `SKCanvas` / `SKBitmap`. This means it will **not** benefit from the GPU path after Phase 3 unless refactored. **Current logic:** - Full-strength: apply `SKColorFilter.CreateCompose(tint, grayscale)` in a single draw.
- Partial-strength (`strength < 100`): draw original, then draw source again with the composed filter at `paint.Color = (255,255,255, blendAlpha)`. The partial-strength blending cannot be expressed as a single color filter (it requires two composited draws). The cleanest refactor:
1. `using var colorized = ApplyColorFilter(source, composedFilter);` -> GPU-eligible, gets the fully-colorized bitmap.
2. Create a new bitmap at source size; draw `source` first (as baseline), then draw `colorized` with `SKPaint { Color = new SKColor(255,255,255,blendAlpha) }` on top. This keeps the visual result identical and gives the GPU path to the expensive color-filter step (step 1). Once refactored, `ColorizeImageEffect` gains the GPU path automatically when Phase 3 is implemented.

### 2.2 `GammaImageEffect` - optional LUT caching [NOTE] LOW PRIORITY

`GammaImageEffect.Apply` builds a 256-byte lookup table on every call:

```csharp
byte[] table = new byte[256]; for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) { ... Math.Pow(val, 1.0 / Amount) ... }
```

For live preview (slider drag), this rebuilds on every frame. Cache `(Amount, table)` as a field; only rebuild when `Amount` changes. **Profile before implementing.**

### 2.3 `BlurImageEffect` - intermediate bitmap reduction [NOTE] LOW PRIORITY

Current chain allocates **3 intermediate bitmaps**: `expanded` -> `blurred` -> `result` (crop). The crop step could be avoided by drawing with a negative translation + clip rect on `blurred`, saving one allocation per call. **Do only if profiling shows allocation pressure.**

### 2.4 `SKFilterQuality` -> `SKSamplingOptions` [NOTE] Reverted - pending SkiaSharp upgrade

SkiaSharp >= 2.88 deprecated `SKFilterQuality` in favour of `SKSamplingOptions`. The migration was implemented and initially marked done, but **subsequently reverted** because SkiaSharp 2.88.9 (the version in use) does not expose the required overloads: `SKCubicResampler.Mitchell` and the `SKBitmap.Resize(SKImageInfo, SKSamplingOptions)` overload are absent in that build. Code reverts to `SKFilterQuality` to maintain a clean build (0 errors, 0 warnings). **Planned replacements** (for when SkiaSharp is upgraded):

| File | Current (reverted) | Planned |
|---|---|---|
| `PixelateImageEffect.Apply` | `new SKPaint { FilterQuality = SKFilterQuality.None }` | `new SKPaint { SamplingOptions = new SKSamplingOptions(SKFilterMode.Nearest) }` |
| `ResizeImageEffect.Apply` | `source.Resize(info, SKFilterQuality.High)` | `source.Resize(info, new SKSamplingOptions(SKCubicResampler.Mitchell))` | **No behaviour change when applied.** Fixes compiler warnings and future-proofs against removal.
> **Action required:** Re-apply after upgrading SkiaSharp past 2.88.9 to a build that exposes these overloads. Regression risk is none - pixelation uses nearest-neighbour and resize uses high-quality cubic; the replacements preserve both.

### 2.5 Redundant `Category` overrides in Filter effects [DONE] `Filters.ImageEffect` (the abstract base in `ShareX.ImageEditor.ImageEffects.Filters`) already sets:

```csharp
public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ImageEffectCategory.Filters;
```

Seven concrete filter effects redundantly re-declare this override when they could simply inherit it:

| File | Action |
|---|---|
| `GlowImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `ReflectionImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `ShadowImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `OutlineImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `BorderImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `SliceImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` |
| `TornEdgeImageEffect.cs` | Remove `public override ImageEffectCategory Category => ...` | **Clean effects** (already inheriting without override): `BlurImageEffect`, `SharpenImageEffect`, `PixelateImageEffect`. **No functional impact.** Do as cleanup alongside any other edit to these files. All seven concrete classes are in `namespace ShareX.ImageEditor.ImageEffects.Filters` so the base class resolves unambiguously.

### 2.6 `SelectiveColorImageEffect` - per-pixel `ToHsl` cost [NOTE] PROFILE FIRST

Every pixel calls `c.ToHsl()` before range detection, even for pixels that end up unmodified. For large images (e.g. 4K ~ 8M pixels), this is ~8M HSL decompositions per apply. A micro-optimisation:
- **Whites/Blacks/Neutrals** ranges depend only on `L` and `S`. Approximate lightness from raw RGB without full HSL decomposition: `L ~ (max(R,G,B) + min(R,G,B)) / 510f * 100`. Skip `c.ToHsl()` for desaturated/near-white/near-black pixels; only call it for chromatic pixels. Adds branch complexity. **Profile first** -> the unsafe pointer loop is already fast; `ToHsl` may not be the bottleneck.

### 2.7 `SliceImageEffect` and `TornEdgeImageEffect` - `new Random()` per call [DONE] Both `SliceImageEffect.Apply` and `TornEdgeImageEffect.Apply` create `new Random()` at the start of every call:

```csharp
Random rand = new Random();
```

**Two problems:** 1. **Determinism during rapid calls:** if `Apply` is triggered multiple times within the same OS timer tick (e.g. live-preview slider), both instances may be seeded identically and produce the same sequence -> visually identical "random" output on consecutive calls.
2. **Unnecessary allocation:** small but avoidable. **Fix:** Use `Random.Shared` (.NET 6+, thread-safe, no allocation):

```csharp
var rand = Random.Shared;
```

Drop the local `Random` variable; replace all `rand.Next(...)` calls in the method body with `Random.Shared.Next(...)`.
> **Regression risk:** None. The fix produces statistically equivalent randomness. The visual output of Slice and TornEdge will differ between calls as intended (no determinism loss).

### 2.8 Diagnostics / observability infrastructure [DONE] Added a host-agnostic diagnostics interface to ImageEditor so GPU path decisions and errors are observable at the host level without coupling ImageEditor to any specific logging framework. **ImageEditor side (`ShareX.ImageEditor.Services`):** - `IEditorDiagnosticsSink` - interface with single method `Report(EditorDiagnosticEvent)`.
- `EditorDiagnosticEvent` - struct carrying `Source`, `Message`, `Level` (`EditorDiagnosticLevel`: Info/Warning/Error), and optional `ExceptionText`.
- `EditorServices.Diagnostics` - static nullable `IEditorDiagnosticsSink?` property; set by the host at startup.
- Emit points: `SetGpuContext()` (context acquired / cleared), `ApplyColorFilter()` (GPU branch taken / CPU fallback reason), and `SKCanvasControl` render callbacks. **XerahS host side (`XerahS.UI.Services`):** - `EditorDiagnosticsAdapter : IEditorDiagnosticsSink` - routes events to `DebugHelper`: Info -> `WriteLine`, Warning -> `WriteLine("WARN :")`, Error -> `WriteException` or `WriteLine("ERROR :")`.
- Wired in `App.axaml.cs` (composition root): `EditorServices.Diagnostics = new EditorDiagnosticsAdapter()`. **Developer tooling:** - `src/desktop/app/run-debug-app.sh` - shell script that resolves `dotnet` (PATH or `~/.dotnet/dotnet`) and launches `XerahS.App.csproj` in Debug configuration, making GPU diagnostics visible on stdout/in the IDE debug output window.

## 3. Phase 3: GPU acceleration - canvas compositor and persistent GRContext

> **Library side [DONE]. Host wiring [DEFERRED].** The `ApplyColorFilter`/`ApplyColorMatrix` GPU path exists and is correct in ImageEditor. Host wiring is intentionally not pursued until this phase: the only viable API path (persistent offscreen `GRContext`, Section 3.3 Option B) has a per-effect readback cost that negates the benefit for color-matrix/filter operations on screenshot-sized images, and the Avalonia 11 frame-scoped lease API cannot be used outside a render callback. The `GRContext?` parameter remains in the API as a zero-cost forward-compatibility hook. Sections 3.1-3.4 document the API constraints; Section 3.3 gives the threading analysis; Section 3.5 documents the threshold already in place.

### Why GPU belongs here and not earlier

**The performance case does not close for Phase 1/2 operations:** | Factor | GPU (Option B) | CPU (current) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Avalonia 11 API stability | [DONE] Independent of Avalonia if Option B | [DONE] No dependency |
| Implementation complexity | [RISK] High - platform GL/Vulkan bootstrap per OS | [DONE] Already done |
| Effect throughput (1080p image, color matrix) | [NOTE] Marginal at best; upload+readback ~ 5-15 ms | [DONE] ~1-3 ms with unsafe pointer loop |
| Effect throughput (4K image, color matrix) | [NOTE] Possible win ~2-4x for compute, but readback still costly | [DONE] ~8-15 ms with unsafe pointer loop |
| Background-thread safe | [DONE] Yes (Option B only) | [DONE] Yes |
| Cross-platform risk | [RISK] GL/EGL/WGL differences; Vulkan not guaranteed | [DONE] None |
| Stability / crash risk | [RISK] GL driver bugs, context loss, out-of-VRAM | [DONE] None |
| Net benefit for screenshot-sized images | [RISK] Usually negative (readback dominates) | [DONE] Already fast | Phase 1/2 effects (brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, color matrix) are a single pass of arithmetic over each pixel. The bottleneck is memory bandwidth, not compute. The optimized CPU path (unsafe pointer arithmetic, `Bgra8888` layout, cache-friendly linear scan) is already within 2-4 cycles/pixel on modern CPUs. A GPU path that uploads the bitmap, dispatches a shader, and reads back the result adds at minimum one full-image PCIe round-trip at each end - for a 1080p image that is ~8 MB x 2 = ~16 MB of PCIe traffic, which at 16 GB/s takes ~1 ms just for transfers, comparable to the entire CPU-side compute. For typical XerahS usage (screenshots, not 4K video frames), GPU is not a win here. **Where GPU does pay off:** The canvas compositor. When multiple annotation layers, effects, and overlays are applied and the result is rendered back to the screen without a CPU readback step, pixels never leave the GPU and the benefit is real. That is the correct place to invest in a persistent `GRContext`. Once the canvas compositor is on-GPU, extending the same `GRContext` to color-matrix/filter effects becomes viable (pixels already on-GPU, no upload cost; only a single final readback). **Recommended action when this phase is started:** 1. Design the canvas compositor to use a persistent offscreen `GRContext` (Option B, Section 3.3).
2. Use that same context for `ApplyColorFilter`/`ApplyColorMatrix` when a composited image is being processed - at that point the upload cost is already paid and the readback happens once at the end.
3. For standalone effect application (no compositor), keep the CPU path - it remains correct and fast.
4. If `ApplyPixelOperation` (ReplaceColor, SelectiveColor) is measurably slow on large images, prefer SIMD intrinsics or parallelised loops over GPU.

### 3.1 Obtain GRContext from Avalonia (host-specific)

> [NOTE] **FRAGILE API WARNING (Avalonia 11 / SkiaSharp 2.88.x).** The pattern originally considered - > `AvaloniaLocator.Current.GetService<IPlatformGraphics>()` -> cast to `ISkiaGpuWithPlatformGraphicsContext` > -> `TryGetGrContext()` - has **two serious problems** in Avalonia 11 that make it unsuitable: > > 1. **`AvaloniaLocator` is deprecated / internals-hostile in Avalonia 11.** The service-locator pattern > used in Avalonia 0.10 was redesigned in Avalonia 11; `AvaloniaLocator.Current` still compiles but is > no longer a stable surface - it can return `null`, change between minor releases, or be removed.

It only works for drawing *to the screen*, not for > computing a new `SKBitmap` from an existing one at arbitrary call sites. > > The only viable runtime path for GPU-accelerated effect application is **Option B** (Section 3.3) - a > persistent offscreen `GRContext` created independently of Avalonia's renderer.
- **XerahS:** No `GRContext` acquisition is currently wired; all effects take the CPU path. When Phase 3 is implemented, a persistent offscreen context (Option B) is required - see Section 3.3.
- **ShareX:** Same. Leave context unset; effects use the software path (no functional change from today).
- **Constraint (if Option B is implemented):** The persistent `GRContext` must be created on a thread that owns the underlying GL/Vulkan context and must be disposed cleanly when the process exits. It is **not** Avalonia's context and is not affected by Avalonia's render lifecycle.

### 3.2 Centralized "apply color filter (with optional GPU)" helper

- **Where:** `ShareX.ImageEditor/Core/ImageEffects/Adjustments/ImageEffect.cs` - update the existing `ApplyColorFilter` and `ApplyColorMatrix` helpers.
- **Current signature (CPU-only):**

```csharp
protected static SKBitmap ApplyColorFilter(SKBitmap source, SKColorFilter filter)
```

- **New signature (optional GPU):**

```csharp
protected static SKBitmap ApplyColorFilter(SKBitmap source, SKColorFilter filter, GRContext? grContext = null)
```

- **GPU path (when `grContext != null`):**
- Create `SKSurface` with `SKSurface.Create(grContext, budgeted: true, imageInfo)` (offscreen GPU render target sized to `source.Width x source.Height`).
- Draw: `canvas.Clear(transparent); canvas.DrawBitmap(source, 0, 0, paintWithFilter);`
- Flush: `surface.Canvas.Flush()` then `surface.Snapshot().ToRasterImage()` (or `surface.PeekPixels()` into a new `SKBitmap`) to read back pixels.
- Return that bitmap and dispose the surface.
- **CPU fallback (when `grContext == null`):** Keep the current `new SKCanvas(result)` implementation unchanged.
- **`ApplyColorMatrix` delegates to `ApplyColorFilter`** (already does); just threads `grContext` through.

### 3.3 Threading and context lifetime

- Effects are today invoked from ViewModels / dialogs and may run on background threads (e.g. for preview or apply).
- **Option A - dispatch to UI/render thread + acquire Avalonia lease:** [RISK] **NOT VIABLE for effect application.** Dispatching to the UI thread does not open a render frame. `ISkiaSharpApiLeaseFeature.Lease()` returns `null` outside an active render callback. This option only works for *drawing to the screen* inside `Render(DrawingContext)` / `ICustomDrawOperation`. It cannot be used to compute a new `SKBitmap` on demand.
- **Option B - persistent offscreen GRContext:** Create a dedicated `GRContext` once (e.g., `GRContext.CreateGl(GRGlInterface.Create())` on Linux/macOS, or the equivalent Vulkan path) that is independent of Avalonia's renderer. Use it on a dedicated background thread (or the thread that created it). This is the **only correct approach** for effect application.
- Pros: works at any call site, background-thread safe, not fragile to Avalonia version changes.
- Cons: requires platform-specific GL/Vulkan bootstrap (EGL on Linux, WGL on Windows, CGL on macOS); adds ~50-200 ms startup cost; GPU->CPU readback cost often negates benefit for small/medium images.
- **GPU threshold:** For images below roughly 2 MP (e.g. `width*height < 2_000_000`), the upload + compute + readback round-trip for simple color matrix/filter operations is rarely faster than the optimized CPU path. GPU benefit is mainly visible for operations that can stay on-GPU (compositing, multi-pass effects). See Section 3.5.

### 3.4 Wiring the context into the effect pipeline

- **`MainViewModel` / `EditorCore`** (code that calls `effect.Apply(source)`) should not know about Skia's GPU; keep the public API as `Func<SKBitmap, SKBitmap>`. All wiring stays inside ImageEditor or is injected by the host.
- Introduce an **optional** "effect context" or "render context" that **either host** can set (e.g. when the editor view is loaded), which carries an optional `GRContext` (or a delegate that returns a scoped GRContext). The effect base or a small "effect runner" in the same assembly can check this and pass the context into `ApplyColorFilter` when calling into the adjustment base.
- Each host that wants GPU: obtain `GRContext` (e.g. at process startup via Option B), store it in a thread-safe way or pass it via a closure to the effect runner. The runner calls existing `Effect.Apply(source)`; the implementation of `ApplyColorFilter` inside the effect library uses the injected context when available. If no context is provided (e.g. ShareX not yet wired), the software path runs - identical behavior for both hosts.
- **`ColorizeImageEffect` note:** Refactored to use the `ApplyColorFilter` helper (see Section 2.1). It will benefit from the GPU path automatically when Phase 3 is wired. **Deliverables (Phase 3):**
- Host (XerahS): create persistent offscreen `GRContext` via Option B (Section 3.3); provide it to the effect pipeline via `EditorServices.SetGpuContext()`. ShareX: optionally wire the same; otherwise leave unset (software path).
- Document that GPU is used only when context is available and above the pixel threshold (Section 3.5).
- Ensure ImageEditor builds and effect behavior is unchanged in both XerahS and ShareX.
- Confirm via `run-debug-app.sh` that diagnostics (Section 2.8) emit "GPU path taken" for color-matrix effects on sufficiently large images.

### 3.5 GPU read-back threshold [DONE] (library code in place) GPU read-back (`surface.Snapshot().ToRasterImage()` or `PeekPixels`) has fixed overhead that dominates for small images. Add a heuristic in `ApplyColorFilter`:

```csharp
const int GpuPixelThreshold = 160_000; // ~400x400 if (grContext != null && source.Width * source.Height >= GpuPixelThreshold) { // GPU path } else { // CPU path (even if grContext is available) }
```

Tune the threshold empirically on real hardware. Document the chosen value. Note: based on the Phase 1/2 analysis, the practical threshold for standalone effect application is closer to 2 MP - the 160 000 px value may be too low and should be revisited when Phase 3 is profiled.

| **3 (library)** | GPU surface via `GRContext` for `ApplyColorFilter`/`ApplyColorMatrix` | [DONE] **DONE** | ImageEditor GPU path ready; host wiring deferred to Phase 3. |
| **3 (host wiring)** | XerahS calls `SetGpuContext(grContext)` to activate GPU path | [DEFERRED] **DEFERRED** | Pursue when canvas compositor is designed (Section 3). |
| **3.5** | GPU read-back threshold | [DONE] **DONE** | 160 000 px threshold in place; revisit value when Phase 3 is profiled. |
| **2.8** | Diagnostics / observability (`IEditorDiagnosticsSink`) | [DONE] **DONE** (Round 3) | GPU path decisions visible in host debug output. |
| **2.2** | `GammaImageEffect` LUT caching | [NOTE] Low priority | Minor live-preview speedup. |
| **2.3** | `BlurImageEffect` allocation reduction | [NOTE] Low priority | One fewer SKBitmap per blur call. |
| **2.6** | `SelectiveColor` `ToHsl` short-circuit | [NOTE] Profile first | Potential speedup at 4K scale. | **Remaining open items:**
- **Phase 3 host wiring - deferred:** Pursue when the canvas compositor is designed. Use persistent offscreen `GRContext` (Option B, Section 3.3); the Avalonia 11 frame-scoped lease API cannot be used outside a render callback. The `GRContext?` parameter stays in the API as a forward-compatibility hook at zero cost.
- **Section 2.4** - Re-apply `SKSamplingOptions` migration after upgrading SkiaSharp past 2.88.9.
- **Section 2.2, Section 2.3, Section 2.6** - Profile-gated; only implement if profiling confirms they are bottlenecks.
